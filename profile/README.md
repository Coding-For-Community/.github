# Welcome to Coding for Community's github page!

This is where we put all of Coding for Community's collaborative projects.
To join this organization, ask one of our leaders (Claire, Brianna, Lingfei or Daniel) to add your account.

## What do we do?

Coding for Community is a club that is designed to assist other clubs/organizations in their coding needs (such as websites). In addition, we plan to start a lot of for-fun coding projects to have our members gain experience.

## What are our current projects?

- Model UN website (Google Sites)
- CA Band website (React)
- CA Tri-M website (React + Django) 
- Robotics Team operator interface (React)
- Hub online menu (HTML/React)

We're open to more project suggestions if you have any.

## How do I start?
We will be teaching most of the basic knowledge you need during club time; however, if you need a quick refresher, click on our .github repository, and click the "Wiki" page. We will have some basic examples/tutorials there.

Here are some skills you need:
- Wordpress
- Google Sites
- Basic Python + Typescript knowledge
- HTML/CSS
- React
- Django

## When do we meet?
Ginger Fridays, 3:05-3:30 in C127. Later on during the year, we might offer more club times. None of the meetings are required, so come when you can!
