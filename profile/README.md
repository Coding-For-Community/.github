# Welcome to Coding for Community's github page!

This is where we put all of Coding for Community's collaborative projects.
To join this organization, ask one of our leaders(Claire, Brianna, Lingfei or Daniel) to add your account.

## What do we do?

Coding for community is a club that is designed to assist other clubs/organizations in their coding needs(such as websites). In addition, we also plan
to start a lot of for-fun coding projects as well to have our members gain experience.

## How do I start?
We will be teaching most of the basic knowledge you need during club time; however, if you need a quick refresher, click on our .github repository, and click the "Wiki" page. Here, we will have some basic examples/tutorials if you need a quick refresher.

## When do we meet?
Ginger Fridays, 2:45-3:05. Later on during the year, we might offer more club times. None of the meetings are required; so come when you can!
